<p align="justify"><font face="Open Sans" size="4">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp A Web application (Web app) is an application program that is stored on a remote server 
and delivered over the Internet through a browser interface. Web services are Web apps 
by definition and many, although not all, websites contain Web apps. According to 
<q> <b>Web.AppStorm editor Jarel Remick</b></q>, any website component that 
performs some function for the user qualifies as a Web app.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Web applications can be designed for a wide variety of uses and can be used by anyone; 
from an organization to an individual for numerous reasons. Commonly used Web 
applications can include webmail, online calculators, or e-commerce shops. Some Web 
apps can be only accessed by a specific browser; however, most are available no matter 
the browser.

<h2><u>How Web applications work</u></h2>
<p><font face="Open Sans" size="3">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Web applications do not need to be downloaded since they are accessed through a network. Users can 
access a Web application through a web browser such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox o,r Safari. For a 
web app to operate, it needs  <a href="file:///D:/cybersec/webserver.htm"> Web server</a>,<a href="file:///D:/cybersec/APPSERVER.HTM"> application server</a>, and a<a href="file:///D:/cybersec/DATABASE.HTM"> database</a>. Web servers manage the 
requests that come from a client, while the application server completes the requested task. A database 
can be used to store any needed information. Web applications typically have short development cycles 
and can be made with small development teams. </font>
</p>
<h3 align="center"><u>FRONT – END DESIGN</u></h3>
<P><font face="Open Sans" size="3">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Most Web apps are written in JavaScript, <abbr text="Hyper Text Markup Language"> HTML5</abbr>, or<abbr text="Cascading Style Sheets" >CSS </abbr>Client-side 
programming typically utilizes these languages, which help build application’s front-end.</font> </P>
<h3 align="center"><u>BACK – END DESIGN</u></h3>
<P><font face="Open Sans" size="3">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Server-side programming is done to create the scripts a Web app will use. Languages such as Python, Java, 
and Ruby are commonly used in server-side programming.</font></P>
